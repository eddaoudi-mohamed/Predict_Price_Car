# Predict Price of a Car

This project aims to predict the price of a car based on various features using machine learning techniques. Below is an overview of the steps involved in the project:

## 1. Scraping Data
The first step involves collecting data from online sources. Web scraping techniques are used to gather car-related data, such as make, model, year, mileage, and price.

## 2. Cleaning Data
The raw data collected is cleaned to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure uniformity. This step ensures the dataset is ready for analysis.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and detect outliers. Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to gain insights into the dataset.

## 4. Preprocessing
Data preprocessing includes encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. This step prepares the data for machine learning models.

## 5. Training
Various machine learning algorithms are trained on the preprocessed data to predict car prices. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

## 6. Evaluation
The trained models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The best-performing model is selected for deployment.

## 7. Deploying
The final model is deployed as a web application or API, allowing users to input car details and receive price predictions.
